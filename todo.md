# potential todos
- learning multivariate Gaussians for classification
  * found in intro to ML HW1
- impact of PCA on KNN performance
  * found in intro to ML HW2
- K Means clustering
- EM algorithm and how it relates to clustering and image compression
  * found in intro to ML HW3
- MLP (multilayer perceptron aka neural net) for digit classification. Maybe even explore convolutional net and use TensorFlow from AI 2
  * found in intro to ML HW4. Tensorflow stuff found in AI II HW 4
- use a package (scikit learn maybe) to show how a SVM works
  * intro to ML HW5 compares SVM to the kernel perceptron (both are discriminative classifiers)
- Basic Bayes Nets stuff. Main idea is that they can represent a full joint distribution with the conditional assumptions between parent nodes and child nodes
  * chapter 14 of AIMA
- Mario Party Q Learning
  * project for AI II. Just show how you represent the problem as a state space and then use RL to find an optimal policy
- Decision Trees
  * found in AI II HW 3-4
